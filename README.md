# Fastquery Builder

## Purpose

Query builder was invented to make easier to build complex queries in a relational database. If you are looking for a library which helps you to make performance queries you came to the right place.

Have you ever came across a query that was a little bit more complex, or you wanted to make it more fast to query in a large database? So we have, and we created this simple library to make our lifes a little bit better and your sistem a lot faster, because we know that most of the bottlenecks of a sistem lies on data fetching on databases.

### Help is always welcome, feel free to clone and make pull requests to improve our library
